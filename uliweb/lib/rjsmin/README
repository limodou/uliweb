INTRODUCTION
============

rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python.

The minifier is based on the semantics of `jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford`_\.

The module is a re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at
runtime (rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the
same results as the original ``jsmin.c``. It differs in the following ways:

- there is no error detection: unterminated string, regex and comment
  literals are treated as regular javascript code and minified as such.
- Control characters inside string and regex literals are left untouched; they
  are not converted to spaces (nor to \n)
- Newline characters are not allowed inside string and regex literals, except
  for line continuations in string literals (ECMA-5).
- "return /regex/" is recognized correctly.
- "+ ++" and "- --" sequences are not collapsed to '+++' or '---'
- rJSmin does not handle streams, but only complete strings. (However, the
  module provides a "streamy" interface).

Since most parts of the logic are handled by the regex engine it's way
faster than the original python port of ``jsmin.c`` by Baruch Even. The speed
factor varies between about 6 and 55 depending on input and python version
(it gets faster the more compressed the input already is). Compared to the
speed-refactored python port by Dave St.Germain the performance gain is less
dramatic but still between 1.2 and 7. See the docs/BENCHMARKS file for
details.

rjsmin.c is a reimplementation of rjsmin.py in C and speeds it up even more.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Both python 2 (>=2.4) and python 3 are supported.


INSTALLATION
============

rJSmin is set up using the standard python distutils. So you can install
it using the usual command:

$ python setup.py install

The command above will install rJSmin into python's library path.

Additionally it will install the documentation. On unices it will be
installed by default into <prefix>/share/doc/rjsmin.

For customization options please study the output of

$ python setup.py --help

Espescially the following options may be interesting for you:

  --without-c-extensions  Don't install C extensions
  --without-docs          Do not install documentation files

Alternatively just copy rJSmin.py into your project and use it.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

A generated API documentation is available in the docs/apidoc/ directory.
But you can just look into the module. It provides a simple function,
called jsmin which takes the script as a string and returns the minified
script as a string.

The module additionally provides a "streamy" interface similar to the one
jsmin.c provides:

$ python -mrjsmin <script >minified

The latest documentation is also available online at
<http://opensource.perlig.de/rjsmin/>.


BUGS
====

No bugs, of course. ;-)
But if you've found one or have an idea how to improve rjsmin,
please send a mail to <rjsmin-bugs@perlig.de>.
